          <p>
            I am a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong interest in
            creating dynamic, user-friendly, and responsive applications. My skills
            span across front-end and back-end development, working with technologies
            such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Django, and Flask. I enjoy bringing
            ideas to life through clean code, modern design, and real-time
            functionality using tools like Socket.IO.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am continuously learning and exploring new technologies to sharpen my
            expertise and deliver high-quality solutions. My goal is to build
            innovative applications that provide seamless user experiences while
            growing as a full-stack developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to
            end, from ideation all the way to development.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me on LinkedIn or
            Instagram, witnessing the journey of startups or enjoying free time.
          </p>
